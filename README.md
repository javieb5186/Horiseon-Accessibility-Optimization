## Description

I was given a website that was not accessible. I made the website accessible as well as inserted comments for new developers to continue on. 

- What was your motivation?
  My motivation is to make my new client happy and develop a long lasting relationship. 

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  I build this project to better understand accessibility and apply coding practices.

- What problem does it solve?
  This makes a non-accessable website, an accessible website.

- What did you learn?
  I learned why accessibility is so important and who is affected. I learned about aria, regions, and roles. Things to consider when 
  creating websites.
